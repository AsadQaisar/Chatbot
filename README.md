# Rule-Based Chatbot

This project implements a **Rule-Based Chatbot** (also known as a **Decision-Tree Bot**) using **Python** and **Tkinter**. The chatbot operates based on a set of predefined rules and can handle a specific set of issues. The flow of conversation is mapped out like a flowchart, where each user input triggers a specific response based on the established decision tree.

## Features

- **Rule-Based Interaction**: The chatbot operates based on predefined rules, ensuring a structured conversation.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built using **Tkinter**, a popular Python GUI library, to provide a simple and intuitive desktop interface.
- **Problem-Solving**: The chatbot is designed to handle specific tasks or queries within the scope of the defined rules.

## Purpose

The project aims to demonstrate how rule-based chatbots operate by following a decision tree structure. It serves as an educational tool to understand how chatbots can be created and deployed in a desktop environment with a graphical interface.
